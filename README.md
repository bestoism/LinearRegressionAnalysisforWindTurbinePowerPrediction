# Linear Regression Analysis for Wind Turbine Power Prediction

This project aims to analyze and model data from a wind turbine to predict its active power output (`LV_Active_Power_kW`). The analysis utilizes Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models from Scikit-learn to evaluate which feature—wind speed or the manufacturer's theoretical power curve—serves as the best predictor.

This notebook covers the entire project lifecycle, from data cleaning and preprocessing, through exploratory data analysis (EDA), to the creation, training, and evaluation of three distinct regression models.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `datafinal.csv`, which contains time-series data from a wind turbine.

**Key Columns:**
*   **DateTime**: Timestamp of the data record (every 10 minutes).
*   **LV_Active_Power_kW**: Active power generated by the turbine (kW) - **Target Variable (y)**.
*   **Wind_Speed_ms**: Wind speed (m/s).
*   **Theoretical_Power_Curve_KWh**: Theoretical power output based on the manufacturer's power curve (KWh).
*   **Wind_Direction**: Wind direction (degrees).

## Project Stages

This project is divided into several main parts within the `Untitled13 (1).ipynb` notebook:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: Loading the `datafinal.csv` dataset, specifying the column separator (`;`) and decimal separator (`,`).
- **Column Renaming**: Renaming columns for better readability and ease of use (e.g., `LV_Active_Power_kW` to `LV_Active_Power`).
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converting the `DateTime` column from `object` to a `datetime` type for time-based analysis.
- **Filter Application**: Filtering the dataset based on the `Filter_Flag` column to use only valid data points.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming the cyclical `Wind_Direction` feature (degrees) into two new features (`Wind_Dir_sin` and `Wind_Dir_cos`) for better representation in linear models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Variable Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of the target variable (`LV_Active_Power`) using a histogram.
- **Relationship Analysis**: Using scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the target variable and key features like `Wind_Speed` and `Theoretical_Power`.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Calculating and visualizing a correlation matrix to understand the linear relationships between numerical features.

### 3. Linear Regression Modeling
To compare predictors, three different Linear Regression models were built and evaluated:

1.  **Model 1**: Predicts `LV_Active_Power` using only `Theoretical_Power`.
2.  **Model 2**: Predicts `LV_Active_Power` using only `Wind_Speed`.
3.  **Model 3**: Predicts `LV_Active_Power` using both `Theoretical_Power` and `Wind_Speed`.

Each model underwent the following steps:
- **Data Splitting**: The data was split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
- **Feature Standardization**: The independent features (X) were scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features are on the same scale.
- **Model Training**: A `LinearRegression` model was trained on the scaled training data.

### 4. Evaluation & Results
Each model was evaluated on the test set using the following metrics:
- **R-squared (R²)**: The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.

**Results Summary:**

| Model                | Features Used                   | R²     | RMSE      | MSE         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Model 1: TheoPower   | `Theoretical_Power`             | 0.9022 | 180.12    | 32443.08    |
| Model 2: WindSpeed   | `Wind_Speed`                    | 0.8327 | 262.46    | 68886.95    |
| Model 3: Theo & Wind | `Theoretical_Power`, `Wind_Speed` | 0.9022 | 180.13    | 32447.88    |

*Note: The values above are inferred from the code; your actual results may vary slightly.*

A **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** analysis for **Model 3** revealed very high multicollinearity between `Theoretical_Power` and `Wind_Speed` (VIF > 9), indicating that these two features provide highly redundant information.

## Conclusion

1.  **Best Predictor**: `Theoretical_Power` (Model 1) is the best single predictor, with an **R² value of ~0.90**, meaning it can explain about 90% of the variability in `LV_Active_Power`.
2.  **Multicollinearity**: Adding `Wind_Speed` to a model that already includes `Theoretical_Power` (Model 3) does not provide any significant performance improvement. This is due to the very high correlation between the two features.
3.  **Model Recommendation**: **Model 1** is the recommended model because it delivers excellent performance with lower complexity (only one feature) and avoids issues of multicollinearity, making it more robust and parsimonious.
